As the main project file is over 25MB it can not longer be uploaded via the built in upload system on the github website.

However it can still be uploaded as a single file using either Git Bash with commands or by using the GitHub Desktop program which is what I did.

If you want to use Git Bash here is a guide :- https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line

If you want to download the Github Desktop program (No commands needed) :- https://desktop.github.com
